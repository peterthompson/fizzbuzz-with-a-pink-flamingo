# FizzBuzz with a Pink Flamingo

Write a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for multiples of five prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. Then extend the program to say “Flamingo” when a number is a member of the Fibonacci sequence, and “Pink Flamingo” when it is a multiple of 3 and 5 and a member of the Fibonacci sequence. Hint: A number is Fibonacci if and only if one or both of (5*n2 + 4) or (5*n2 – 4) is a perfect square (i.e. A number made by squaring a whole number).
